# Voxelite
**Code your own world!**

3D block-based game and game engine.

Main purpose of this project is to create fast, cross-platform game with different experience on each server and painless transition between them.

## Current Status

Voxelite is under development inside of private repositories until good-enough working prototype is created.

The project is already split into multiple components (repositories) to keep better control over different parts of the project.

It is also blocked by development of AWEngine from [GrayMadness](https://github.com/graymadness) as it is the Game Engine (Low-Level API) the project is using.
